🎯 Number Guessing Game (C)
📖 Overview :

The Number Guessing Game is a console-based application developed in C that challenges the user to guess a predefined secret number within a limited number of attempts.
The program provides real-time hints after each guess and clearly communicates success or failure based on the user’s performance.

This project demonstrates the practical application of control structures, loops, and user input handling in C programming.


🎯 Objective :

The objective of this project is to :

🎮 Implement an interactive game using C

🔢 Allow users to guess a secret number within fixed attempts

💡 Provide meaningful feedback (hints) after each guess

✅ Determine and display a clear win or loss outcome


⭐ Features :

🔐 Fixed secret number

⏳ Limited number of attempts

💬 Hint system for incorrect guesses

🏆 Clear success and failure messages

🖥️ Simple and user-friendly console interface


🔄 Program Flow :

🔢 A secret number is stored in the program

⏱️ The maximum number of attempts is defined

⌨️ The user is prompted to enter a guess

🔍 The program compares the guess with the secret number

💡 Hints are displayed for incorrect guesses

🔁 The game continues until success or attempts are exhausted

📢 The final result (Win / Lose) is displayed


🧮 Algorithm :

🟢 Initialize the secret number

📌 Set the maximum allowed attempts

🔁 Use a loop to control guessing chances

⌨️ Read user input using scanf

🔍 Compare the guess with the secret number

🎉 Display success message if matched

📉 Display hints for higher or lower guesses

🛑 End the game after win or loss


🛠️ Technologies Used :

💻 Language: C

🧰 IDE: Visual Studio Code

🖥️ Platform: Console Application

🌐 Version Control: GitHub


📚 Learning Outcomes :
